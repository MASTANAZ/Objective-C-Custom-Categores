 Insertion sorts build a final sorted array one object at a time.

 behind it. At each array position, it will check the value against
 the largest value in the sorted list. If it is larger, it leaves the 
 object in place and moves to the next one. If it is smaller, it finds
 the correct position within the sorted list, shifts all larger values
 up one index, then inserts the object into its correct position.
